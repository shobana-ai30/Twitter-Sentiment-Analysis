The input dataset is a csv file containing the annotated tweets, date and time of tweet and the class label. The tweets were downloaded from Twitter during a presidential debate between Obama and Romney some years ago.
Label 1 indicates positive sentiment, -1 indicates negative sentiment and 0 indicates neutral sentiment respectively. Label 2 indicates mixed sentiment ( consisting of positive, negative and neutral sentiments) 
However, that was later discarded as it was not required.
The output is stored in two text files, one each for Obama and Romney where the predicted class label is added to its corresponding tweet id.
